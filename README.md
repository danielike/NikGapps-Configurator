#  NikGapps Configurator
Simple script to automate the modify of NikGapps configuration file. No more tedious unzipping/zipping only to do that.

##  Usage
Just put the NikGapps.zip file on the same folder that the script and gapps.txt, and executes it.
 
The gapps.txt has the same structure than nikgapps.config. Edit whatever value you want, and save it before executing the script. The nikgapps.config inside the .zip will be replaced with gapps.txt values.
